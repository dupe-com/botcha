# Reports

This directory stores internal analysis and planning notes.

## Layout

- `archive/legacy/` — historical root-level docs moved out of the repository root to reduce clutter.
- `archive/2026-02-20/` — one-time deep-dive and merge-planning reports from the 2026-02-20 epic review session.

## Keep vs Archive

Keep in root docs (`README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `BUGS.md`, `doc/*`) only the current product contract and active work.
Archive release/session-specific notes here once they are no longer execution-critical.
