## [0.22.0] — 2026-02-20

### Protocol Integrations (5 epics)

Three epics merged to main (PRs #25, #27, #29). Two in progress (PRs #26, #28 — pending merge).

#### ✅ x402 Payment Gating (PR #25 — merged)

HTTP 402 micropayment flow using USDC on Base. Agents can pay $0.001 USDC for a BOTCHA token instead of solving a challenge. BOTCHA also acts as a lightweight x402-compatible facilitator.

**New endpoints:**
- `GET /v1/x402/info` — public, payment config discovery
- `GET /v1/x402/challenge` — pay $0.001 USDC → receive BOTCHA access_token (no puzzle)
- `POST /v1/x402/verify-payment` — verify raw x402 payment proof (requires Bearer auth)
- `POST /v1/x402/webhook` — settlement notifications from x402 facilitators (Coinbase CDP)
- `GET /agent-only/x402` — demo endpoint: requires BOTH BOTCHA token + x402 payment

**Fixes included:**
- `POST /v1/x402/verify-payment` now correctly requires Bearer auth (was open)
- JSON 404 handler for unknown routes

See [doc/X402.md](./doc/X402.md) for the integration guide.

#### ✅ ANS (Agent Name Service) Integration (PR #27 — merged)

BOTCHA as a verification layer for the GoDaddy-led Agent Name Service standard. DNS-based agent identity lookup with BOTCHA-issued ownership badges.

**New endpoints:**
- `GET /v1/ans/botcha` — public, BOTCHA's own ANS identity
- `GET /v1/ans/resolve/:name` — public, DNS-based ANS lookup by name
- `GET /v1/ans/resolve/lookup?name=` — public, alternate DNS lookup via query param
- `GET /v1/ans/discover` — public, list BOTCHA-verified ANS agents
- `GET /v1/ans/nonce/:name` — auth required, nonce for ANS ownership proof
- `POST /v1/ans/verify` — auth required, verify ANS ownership + issue BOTCHA badge

**Fixes included:**
- Auth check on `POST /v1/ans/verify` now happens BEFORE DNS lookup (was 422 without auth)
- 2-part domain names (e.g. `botcha.ai`) now correctly resolve to `_ans.botcha.ai` (was `_ans.ai`)
- ANS version prefix parsing fixed (`v1.0.x` now correctly parsed)
- All 37 unit tests passing

See [doc/ANS.md](./doc/ANS.md) for the integration guide.

#### ✅ DID/VC Issuer — W3C Verifiable Credentials (PR #29 — merged)

BOTCHA as a W3C DID/VC issuer (`did:web:botcha.ai`). Issues portable W3C Verifiable Credential JWTs that any party can verify offline using BOTCHA's public JWKS — no round-trip to BOTCHA required.

**New endpoints:**
- `GET /.well-known/did.json` — public, BOTCHA DID Document (`did:web:botcha.ai`)
- `GET /.well-known/jwks` — public, JWK Set (extended to include DID signing keys)
- `GET /.well-known/jwks.json` — public, JWK Set alias (some resolvers append `.json`)
- `POST /v1/credentials/issue` — auth required (BOTCHA token), issues W3C VC JWT
- `POST /v1/credentials/verify` — public, verify any BOTCHA-issued VC JWT
- `GET /v1/dids/:did/resolve` — public, resolve `did:web` DIDs

**Fixes included:**
- Preview env gets static EC key (`JWT_SIGNING_KEY`) so JWKS and DID doc aren't empty
- `POST /v1/credentials/verify` returns 503 (not 200) when server is not configured
- Both `JWT_SECRET` + `JWT_SIGNING_KEY` set in preview env vars

See [doc/DID-VC.md](./doc/DID-VC.md) for the integration guide.

#### 🔄 A2A Agent Card Attestation (PR #26 — in progress, pending merge)

BOTCHA as a trust seal issuer for the Google A2A protocol Agent Cards.

**Planned endpoints (not yet in main):**
- `GET /.well-known/agent.json` — BOTCHA's A2A Agent Card
- `GET /v1/a2a/agent-card` — BOTCHA's A2A Agent Card (alias)
- `POST /v1/a2a/attest` — attest an agent's A2A card → BOTCHA trust seal
- `POST /v1/a2a/verify-card` — verify attested card (tamper-evident hash check)
- `POST /v1/a2a/verify-agent` — verify agent by card or `agent_url`
- `GET /v1/a2a/trust-level/:agent_url` — get trust level for an agent URL
- `GET /v1/a2a/cards` and `GET /v1/a2a/cards/:id` — registry browsing

**Known issues (pre-merge):**
- Re-attesting same `agent_url` creates duplicate attestations
- `ATTESTATION_FAILED` error code used for field validation errors (should be `INVALID_CARD`)

**Recent pre-merge fixes pushed:**
- Added `/v1/a2a/agent-card` alias route
- Added missing `/v1/a2a/verify-agent` and `/v1/a2a/trust-level/:agent_url` routes
- Fixed `verify-agent` route typing/call-order bugs and compile breakage

See [doc/A2A.md](./doc/A2A.md) for the draft guide.

#### 🔄 OIDC-A Attestation (PR #28 — in progress, pending merge)

Enterprise agent authentication chains: Entity Attestation Tokens (EAT/RFC 9711) and OIDC-A agent claims.

**Planned endpoints (not yet in main):**
- `GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` — OAuth/OIDC-A discovery
- `POST /v1/attestation/eat` — issue Entity Attestation Token (EAT/RFC 9711)
- `POST /v1/attestation/oidc-agent-claims` — issue OIDC-A agent claims block
- `POST /v1/auth/agent-grant` — agent grant flow (OAuth2-style)
- `GET /v1/auth/agent-grant/:id/status` — grant status
- `POST /v1/auth/agent-grant/:id/resolve` — approve/resolve grant
- `GET /v1/oidc/userinfo` — OIDC-A UserInfo endpoint

**Known issues (pre-merge):**
- OIDCA routes not yet in OpenAPI spec (`static.ts`)

**Recent pre-merge fixes pushed:**
- Secured grant status polling (`GET /v1/auth/agent-grant/:id/status`) with bearer auth + app ownership checks
- Secured grant resolution (`POST /v1/auth/agent-grant/:id/resolve`) with bearer auth + app ownership checks
- Added strict positive `ttl_seconds` validation on EAT issuance
- Corrected JWKS discovery references to `/.well-known/jwks`
- Added focused OIDC-A tests in `tests/unit/agents/tap-oidca.test.ts`

See [doc/OIDCA.md](./doc/OIDCA.md) for the draft guide.
