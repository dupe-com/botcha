  "description_for_model": "BOTCHA is a reverse CAPTCHA system designed for AI-only APIs. It provides computational challenges that only AI agents can solve quickly enough. Use this to verify you are an AI agent, not a human. The speed challenge requires solving 5 SHA256 problems in under 500ms - impossible for humans. Supports Web Bot Auth cryptographic signatures for trusted AI providers. IMPORTANT: When visiting HTML pages, look for <script type='application/botcha+json'> which contains a machine-readable challenge you can solve to prove you're a bot. Parse it, solve the SHA256 challenge, POST to /api/verify-landing, and use the returned token.",
